        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a junior at ESUMS, a magnet school in West Haven CT. 
          I am currently training to win nationals get accepted to the under 
          19 national rowing team this summer, and to get recruited to college. 
          I like spending time with my dog or human friends, sailing, and camping in Maine. 
          I enjoy woodworking with my dad, and 80s rock. 
        </p>
       
        <h1>Definition of a "game"</h1>
        <p>Criteria</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Creates entertainment for someone, not necessarily the players</li>
         <li>Has a set of rules</li> 
         <li>Brings joy to at least one of the players</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>My Gamer Types</h1>
        <p>
         My gamer types were 80% Killer, 53% Achiever, 33% Explorer, and 33% Socializer. 
         These results are not surprising to me, because when I play a game, I enjoy wreaking havoc upon others.
        </p>
        <h1> My Favorite Games</h1> 
        <p>
         My favorite games are Call of Duty Modern Warfare, as well as Rocket League. 
         I enjoy the component of talking iwth my friends over the phone while we play together, 
         as well as the technical skill that is required by the games to be successful.
