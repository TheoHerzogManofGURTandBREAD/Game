        <h1>Explorations Documentations</h1>
      <p> During the board game creation activity, we were tasked with creating an engaging game that involved the types of 
        characters and functions that were outlined. I learned that it wastougher thna expected to create a game that was engaging, 
        easy to play, and functional. When we created the 2D game, I was shocked by how much coding went behind such a simple code, 
        which makes bigger games like Rainbow Six Siege even more fascinating and impressive.
