      <p>
        I might use a game to draw attention to the issue of pollution through a game, demonstrating the
        amount of trash the average American creates, and how much of it ends up in nature. The game will
        show how difficult it is not to litter in modern day, so that they will put more effort into being 
        environmentally friendly.
